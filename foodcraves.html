		<p>Sooooooooo.......................... you're craving something salty are ya?
		</p>
		<p>Dreaming of this?????????<p>

		<h3>Jerky</h3>
		<p>Body builders love beef jerky because its a high energy snack. 
		Little snacks like slim jims and jerkey are a great way to elimate salty cravings. They are high in protein and relatively low calorie snacks. They are also high in iron
		 and zinc. Most people think beef jerky is very processes and bad for you but that is not true! Not to mention, beef jerky is a convenient snack on the go. 
		</p>
		<h3>Nuts</h3>
		<p>Nuts have protein and healthy fats. An oz of mixed nuts only contains 173 calories. Nuts like walnuts, cashews and pecans are decievingly high calorie, but they should 
		be incorporated into your diet to benefit from the protein, fat, fiber, vitamin E, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, manganese, selenium and antioxidants. Of course, as long as you don't have
		a nut allergy because that would be a dumb idea and you will probably die. If your scared of calories almonds are a great nut choice!</p>
		<h3>Veggie Chips</h3>
		<p>Craving potato chips? Veggie chips are great alternative. There are tons of different brands but most of them are delicous. They are lower in calories, depending on your brand of choice, 
		and sodium as apposed to regular potato chips. Potato chips are also very greasy. Rather than eating regular potato chips, 
		adding veggie chips to your diet will at least give you some vitamins from the vegetables. The idea is portion control here. Yes, its a better alternative to regular potato chips 
		but its easy to overeat so watch your serving size.</p>
		<h3>Avocado</h3>
		<p>These contain a ton of healthy fats. They are low in sugar and have a little fiber. 1/5 of an avacado is 64 calories. They are a great source of Vitamin C, E, K and B6. Magnesium and potatssium are present. 
		They provide omega-3 fatty acids. Vitamin K, will help your bones stay healthy. Avocados are great with toast, salads and even just an avocado!
		</p>
		<h3>Popcorn</h3>
		<p>Tip: watch the butter. Popcorn can be a healthy snack if you let it be. It is naturally low in fat and in calories. 3 cups of air popped popcorn is just 110 calories and 1 gram of fat. Its even a whole grain. 
		Popcorn includes minerals like, calcium, copper, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc. Vitamins present include B6, A, E, K, folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, and pantthenic acid. This is a great 
		savory treat but it can also be sweet! You can add some raisons and dark chocolate and waBAM.</p>
		<h1 id="sweet">Sweet Cravings</h1>
		<p>Sooooooooo.......................... you're craving something sweet are ya?
		</p>
		<p>Dreaming of this?????????<p>

		<h3>Berries</h3>
		<p>Berries contain antioxidants. Next to pomegranates, they are the fruits with the highest antioxidant count. They are high in fiber so you will feel full longer. Not to mention, they are sweet and delicous. In one cup of blueberries, 
		there are only 85 calories! Thats a lot of blueberries. Its a perfectly low calorie, delcious snack. </p>
		<h3>Dark Chocolate</h3>
		<p>Now what your probably thinking right now is... chocolate? How could THAT be healthy. You would be surprised at all the various benefits of dark chocolate. Dark Chocolate has fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese and potassium.
		Obviously, it is chocolate, so it should be eaten in moderation. A nice dessert once in a while though. Be careful again, as a little caffeine can keep you up at night. Dark chocolate contains less sugar than milk and white.
It also has some organic compounds that function as antioxidants. </p>
		<h3>Sugar Free Gum</h3>
		<p>Sometimes, a sweet craving might be fulfilled by chewing on something sweet. Gum is a good option for this. A stick is only 5 calories. 
		A plus side of gum is your mouth will taste minty fresh when you over it.
		</p>
		<h3>Sweet Potato</h3>
		<p>These potatoes are nutritious, sweet, and filling. Sweet potatoes are high in carbs  but also rice in fiber. They include vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium.
		They even have antioxidants. 
		A lot of the times when you have any late night or sweet cravings, your probably just craving carbs or even sugar. Sweet potatoes are a great option. 
		</p>
		<h3>Diet Coke</h3>
		<p>Diet coke has no calories and is sweet enough to fulfill your sweet cravings. THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY DRINK. I REPEAT THIS IS NOT HEALTHY. Its very processed
		and should be drank in moderation. Its very filling and can be mistaken for a full meal.
