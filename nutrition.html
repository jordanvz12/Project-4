		<h3>Vitamin K </h3>
		<p>This vitamin is often an overlooked vitamin as apposed to calcium and vitamin D but vitamin K promotes bone health.
		This vitamin is known as the blood-clotting vitamin. That is, this vitamin is important for healing wounds. Leafy greens like kale, spinach 
		and parsley contain vitamin K. </p>
		<h3>Vitamin D </h3>
		<p>Vitamin D shouldn't be overlooked either. Vitamin D deficiencies are pretty common especially in the winter. This is because it is the sun
		vitamin. Vegans are especially prone to vitamin D deficiencies. This vitamin helps you absorb calcium. This vitamin, unfortunately, is not naturally
		present in many foods. Vitamin D is present in fatty fishes like salmon and tuna. A sushi roll could give you some vitamin D! You like a good spicy
		tuna? Its also present in orange juice and egg yolks.</p>
		<h3>Magnesium</h3>
		<p>This vitamin promotes bone health, calcium absorbtion, and anxiety relief. It helps your enzymes function. Magnesium is present in sunflower seeds, almonds and shrimp. 
		Also note: females! It helps with cramps.

		<h1 id="facts">Nutrition Fact Guide</h1>
		<h3>Calories</h3>
		<p>Do you ever even look at the labels on your foods? Its important to note that this is NOT something you should obsess about.
		Awareness, on the other hand is VERY important. Nutrition labels love to add, "based on a 2,000 calorie diet" but, in reality not everyone should
		be consuming 2,000 calories. The amount of calories you consume in a day, depends on your height and weight. It also depends on, are you trying to lose weight?
		Are you trying to gain weight or even maintain? It is reccomended for EVERYONE to not eat less than 1,200 calories. There are plenty of LINKtrackers to help 
		you determine what you should be consuming a day, depending on your goals or desires. It's not bad to count calories, but do not let it consume your life. It is
		about making better choices.
		</p>
		<h3>Sugar</h3>
		<p>Have you ever noticed the percents on nutrition labels? Those percents are based off of a 2,000 calories diet and determine what % that takes up during the day.
		But, sugar? NEVER a % for sugar. There is a specific reason for that. If they added how much the % of sugar on nutrition labels, the people who produce those 
		foods would make less money. In reality people consume WAY to much sugar, and its probably the substance most people are addicted to on the planet. Consuming 
		too muuch sugar can lead to plenty of illnesses, so its important to be aware that the amount of sugar you consume MATTERS.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<p>You ever look at the ingredients on a nutrition label and not know 90% of what the words mean? A nice rule of thumb for looking at ingredients lists, is that if there are more 
		than 5 ingredients, it probably is not a healthy option. Now, dont take that too seriously, there are healthy foods with more than five ingredients but it is a simple rule of thumb.
