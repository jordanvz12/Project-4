		<h1 id="fasting">Fasting</h1>
		<p>Intermittent fasting involves completely obstaining from food and calories for a period of time before going back to regular eating patterns. There are several ways 
		to do this. 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>16:8</li>
			<li>12:12</li>
			<li>20:4</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The ways these plans work is too fast for 16, 12 or even 20 hours and eat during the rest of the time. There are plenty of other variations including fasting for a 2 days and 
		eating normally for the rest. Or even doing on day of fasting and another day of normal eating. There are even mobile apps available to help motivate you to not eat or "fast". You
		can log your moods and it will remind you when the fast is over. There is a huge community of people who use fasting in order to lose weight. 
		</p>
		<h3>Pro's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Less of a change to overeat.</li>
			<li>Boosts Metabolism</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Con's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Can lead too overrestriction which hinders metabolism</li>
			<li>Overexersice can lead to fainting or health complications</li>
			<li>Possible Health Risks</li>
			<li>Social stigma, isolation: Let's face it, hanging out with friends or family a lot of the times involves eating. It can be quite isolating having
			to avoid foods at all costs.</li>
			<li>Does NOT work well with people who are constantly active and will probably result in binging.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you are planning on using intermittent fasting as a tool to lose weight please <b>talk to your doctor</b></p>
		<h1 id="omad">OMAD</h1>
		<p>OMAD stands for One Meal A Day. What most people learn growing up is too eat 3 meals a day, breakfast, lunch and dinner plus snacks. 
		How could one live off One Meal A Day? If you do research on this diet the conclusion to the question is it safe essentially is: probably. Probably? 
		The idea is if you only eat one meal, even if its a GIANT meal it will probably be less calories than eating 3 meals plus snacks in a full day. There is not a 
		lot of research on this diet but people still do it!</p>
		<h3>Pro's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Less of a chance to overeat.</li>
			<li>Fits into busy schedules.</li>
			<li>Can lead to healthy more nutrional food choices.</li>
			<li>Less of a need to meticulously count calories.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Con's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Is it safe? WHO KNOWS</li>
			<li>Might be hindering the amount of energy to complete daily tasks before meal time</li>
			<li>Can hinder metabolism</li>
			<li>On the other side you may OVEREAT.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>This type of diet solely depends on you. What are your food choices like? How nutritious is 
		your meal? How do you FEEL? You may feel full, you may be deprived. This type of diet lacks structure so people who
		follow this diet might make unhealthy choices. Do your research and listen to your bodies cues. This diet can be safe if done properly. If you make proper food choices,
		it elimates the need to calorie count and obsess over food. 
		</p>
		<h1 id="vegan">Vegans</h1>
		<p>This type of diet involves completely obstaining from any time of meat products. This includes not only meat, but 
		dairy and eggs as well. Not everyone becomes a vegan just to lose weight. Some enviromentally concious people decide to go vegan, or 
		a better way to put it, "GO GREEN". </p>
		<h3>Pro's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Forces you to focus on healthy eating.</li>
			<li>Elimating dairy, and eating lots of vegetables and fruits will help your skin THRIVE.</li>
			<li>Weight loss</li>
			<li>Enviromentally friendly.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Con's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Food often will cost more.</li>
			<li>Very easy to get vitamin deficiencies. When you cut out foods that carry important vitamins and 
			nutrients its important to replace those foods with others.</li>
			<li>Eating at restaurants or around non-vegans pose challenges.</li>
			<li>Excessive weight loss can turn into excessive weight gain. Because the diet 
			is so restrictive its possible to overcompensate on high carb foods.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 id="keto">Keto Diet</h1>
		<p>This diet is a low carb diet, but high in fat. The reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.
		When your body is in this state it becomes very efficient at burning fat for energy. This is because your body uses carbs as a first resort for energy.
		Without carbs your body uses energy stored elsewhere. Something to keep in mind if you decide to use this diet is just because you are free to eat fat
		does not mean it will be beneficial to eat junky foods. Fats should come from foods like avacados and nuts. <br>The standard keto diet consists of 
		75% fats, 20% protein, and 5% carbs.</p>
		<h3>Pro's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Because its high in fats this diet elimates feeling hungry all the time.</li>
			<li>Less prone to crave sugar because meals are filling</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Con's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Still need to watch calorie intake because fats are high calorie.</li>
			<li>Initial weight loss is water weight.</li>
			<li>Limited research in long-term effects.</li>
			<li>Initial "Brain Fog" because your body knows to run on gluecose, and fat 
			is slower source of fuel.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h1 id="gluten">Gluten Free</h1>
		<p>This type of diet completely cuts out gluten. What is gluten? You may ask; essentially gluten is in everything that is DELICOUS. Gluten is in flower
		so to be "gluten free" would mean: no bread, cake, pancakes, waffles, pizza, and the list goes on. There are gluten free alernatives and some almost even taste
		the same. Sounds like hell. Some people unfortunetly, dont have a choice and are actually 
		allergic to gluten. Those who can eat gluten, but have this type of diet believe it is 
		an effective way to lose weight. </p>
		<h3>Pro's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Low carb diet</li>
			<li>Encourages food awareness. On a gluten free diet you have to actually READ labels and ingredients to see what is 
			in your food.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Con's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Gluten is in all foods that taste good.</li>
			<li>Makes eating at restaurants difficult.</li>
			<li>Can result in vitamin deficiencies such as Iron, Calcium, Fiber, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, & Folate.</li>
			<li>Gluten free options often cost more money.</li>
		</ul>
