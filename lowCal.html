		<h1> Introduction </h1>
		<p>Now, this is not a food blog, but this website is meant to help people make better choices, so these are various food you can eat at all 
		times of day, that are nutrient dense, low calorie, delicous, and healthy. I provide some options and brief description on how to go about making certain foods.
		So yes, they are recipes per say; RECIPES FOR SUCCESS! Mindful eating is an important practice so you look and feel good. Most of the food reccomendations
		are easy to make.</p>
		<h1 id="breakfast">Breakfast</h1>
		<h3>Oatmeal</h3>
		<p>Oatmeal is one of the healthiest grains and its relatively low calorie. Oats are loading with important vitamins as well. They include
		manganese, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, iron, zinc, folate, vitamin B1 (thiamin), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). As you can tell they 
		oats are nutrient dense. A half a cup of oatmeal is around 150 calories. They are best with some milk. Some prefer oats to be runny rather than 
		thick. What I have found, is the perfect equilibrium; to use both water and milk. A half a cup of oats with 1/2 a cup of water, and a 1/2
		a cup of milk. This not only makes them delicous but less milk decreases the calorie content of the oats. You can also use different kind of milk
		like oat milk, almond milk or even soy if thats what you like. To make them a little sweeter its nice to add some sweetner or if you want to add 
		some more calories you can use regular white or brown sugar. Using regular sugar decreases the amount of processed sugar and is easier to digest than
		sweeteners.</p> <p>Oats are very flexible. Its a great breakfast for everyday. Its impossible to get sick of because there are so many healthy things to add
		to change up the flavor. Fruit and nuts go great in oatmeal. It is even nice once in a while, to add some dark chocolate. Spices that go nice with oatmeal are 
		pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, maybe even some nutmeg. A very small drop of vanilla goes a long way.</p><p>There are instant oatmeal packets that elimate
		the need to add your own spices. It makes breakfast on the go easy! The only problem with prepackaged oats is they are largely processed foods. Still, a healthy 
		filling breakfast. 
		</p>
		<h3>Eggs</h3>
		<p>Eggs, similar to oatmeal are very nutrient dense. They contain Vitamins A, B5, B12, D, E, K, and B6, Folate, Phosphorus, Selenium,
		Calcium, Zinc, Protein and healthy fats. Egg yolks contain antioxidants that reduce the risk of cataracts in the eyes. Vitamin A is also good for eye health.
		Eggs also help you feel full longer, because of the protein and the healthy fats.</p>
		<p>Eggs can be prepared plently of different ways so its another breakfast that is impossible to get sick of. Omelets can be loaded with vegetables, meats, and cheeses.
		There are hard boiled eggs, over easy, sunny side up, scrambled, benedict. There are an endless amount of possibilities. 1 large egg contains 78 calories. If you are watching your calorie
		intake egg whites are an easy, simple and tasty alternative, although some egg yolk is not the end of the world. 
		A delicous way to prepare egg whites is too add a dash of salt, some light cheese, and cilantro. Depending on how many egg whites you use, a normal serving is only 170 calories (if you take it easy
		on the cheese). Don't get me wrong, eggs can be calorie dense, but it all depends on how they are prepared. For example, if you go to IHop and decide you want
		to go low calorie and order an omelet, DON'T. Omelets at iHop range from around 700 calories to 1300 calories. That is INSANE for breakfast. Although they do look pretty good....
		</p>
		<h1 id="lunch">Lunch</h1>
		<h3>Salads</h3>
		<p>UHG BORING. You may think so, but what about pasta salad? What about a nice chicken caesar? What about PESTO? There are so many different types of salads and some may decieving calorie wise. 
		My favorite pesto pasta salad recipe, 1 lemon, walnuts, a splash of olive oil, a generous amount of basil and garlic, and a little parmeson cheese all in the food processor. Whip up some pasta and add the pesto. 
		Add some argugala and BAM! Delicous pesto pasta recipe. You can make enough and meal prep for the week. This recipe has grains, leafy greens, 
		protein, whole grains and citrus. Even dairy from the cheese!</p>
		<p>If you ever need to grab and go, panera has amazing, low calorie, nutrious options. My favorite option for a quick lunch is a chicken caesar salad. The whole salad is only 441 calories and is extremely filling.
		There is even an option for a half salad, or less the chicken for those non meat eaters. Try a couple different salads out and see what you like! There is always a recipe for everyone. 
		</p>
		<h3>Soup</h3>
		<p>Who doesn't love a bowl of soup? Soup is filling, and mainly delicous. Because of how soup is prepared, it perserves the vitamins and minerals in the foods you use in the soup, so healthy?
		It depends but if you cook your own soup, you know exactly what is going into it. Personally, I go for a lemon, chicken soup with rice. Its a great soup with orzo as well, but to keep calorie content down
		rice is the next best choice. A serving is only around 289 calories. The lemon provides antioxidants, and vitamin C. The chicken provides protein and the rice
		has heathly grains. There are an endless amount of soups. Again, possibilites? Endless. </p>
		<h1 id="dinner">Dinner</h1>
		<h3>Baked Chicken</h3>
		<p>This is a simple, quick and healthy dinner option. 1 chicken breast is around 230 calories. Throw your favorite spices on the chicken. Some reccomended spices: braii spice, black pepper, red pepper, peri peri seasoning or even some lemon.
		Baked chicken is customized to your palete. Just set the chicken breast on some foil, and toss it in the oven! Chicken is rice is protein, phosphorus, selenium, and niacin.
		Vitamin B6 is there to help support your metabolism. An interested aspect of chicken is that it increases the sertatonin amino acid levels in your brain, which a natural mood buster! Vitamin A and b2 are also prevelant. If you want 
		a little more than just chicken, adding some rice on the side is acceptable. Another side option is a plate of vegetables!</p>
		<h3>Rice & Beans</h3>
		<p>This meal is rich in protein and fiber.This is a great meal for all  you vegetarians. Another interesting thing about rice and beans is when combined together, they form a symbiotic relationship in which the amino acids of each item complement one another to form a complete
		protein. Beans also contain complex carbohydrates. Im not going to lie is not my favorite meal so I am not going to brag about the taste of it but its definely a filling and nutrious dinner! It would be smart to add a little side of vegetables. 
		</p>
		
		<h1 id="dessert">Dessert</h1>
		<h3>Fruit Salad</h3>
		<p>Fruits are sweet and delicous! Its a much safer bet than a slice of cake or processed cookies you go to buy in quickcheck at 3 in the morning. The best part about fruit salad,
		is that it doesn't need salad dressing! Fruit salad is great because of all the fruit juices that collect at the bottom. It's the best tropical drink. Something about all the flavor from all the various fruits including
		 that really, really hits the spot. 
		</p>
		<h3>Dark Chocolate</h3>
		<p>Now what your probably thinking right now is... chocolate? How could THAT be healthy. You would be surprised at all the various benefits of dark chocolate. Dark Chocolate has fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese and potassium.
		Obviously, it is chocolate, so it should be eaten in moderation. A nice dessert once in a while though. Be careful again, as a little caffeine can keep you up at night. Dark chocolate contains less sugar than milk and white.
It also has some organic compounds that function as antioxidants. 		
		<h1 id="snacks">Snacks</h1>
		<h3>Rice Cakes</h3>
		<p>These low calorie snacks are a MUST. If you want sweet or savory they exist. Its a great way to fill up, volume eat, or even replace the need for potato chips.
		 The long stick looking ones are only 60 calories each! Not only that but they go as low as 35 calories each. Now, to be fare, they are NOT high in fiber or protein. 
		 This is because they are essentially just rice and air. If you are looking for a low calorie snack, these are great. To make this treat a little healthier it can be paired with some sort of fiber.
		  Rice cakes are almost fat free. They are also a good gluten-free option.
		 </p>
		<h3>Fruits</h3>
		<p>Fruits are great! They contain vitamin C, potassium, dietary fiber and folic acid. Potassium helps maintain proper blood pressure. Potassium can be found in bananas, prunes, peaches and apricots, and even melons.
		Dietary fiber helps reduce cholesterol levels. Fibers good for your digestive system.  Vitamin
		 C is important for growth and repair of body tissues. </p>
		<h3>Vegetables</h3>
		<p>Vegetables are great because you can basically eat as much of them as you want! They are nutrious and filling. Its not difficult to make vegetables taste good either. 
		A little salt and pepper goes a long way. Its not a sin to add a little butter as long as its in moderation. Dark greens are the most nutrious. Vegetables are one of those 
foods that can be eaten in so many different ways. Cheesy broccoli? Coliflower mash? Carrots with ranch? Celery with ranch? Again, endless possibilites. 
Coliflower mash is one of my favorites. It is easiest if you pick up riced cauliflower from the super market. Its cheap, and low calorie. Throw it in the food processer or mash it up with a mixer.
A little butter, milk, maybe some cheese, GARLIC, you can add some sour cream, black pepper... its actually difficult to make cauliflower mash UNHEALTHY. Again, the answer is always moderation especially
with the cheese and such. It's an easy snack that could easily become a meal because SO DELICOUS!</p>
		<h3>Yogurt</h3>
		<p>Yogurt contains tons of calcium. It also has B12, riboflavin, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium. Yogurt is also high in protein. Therefore yogurt should help build your metobilsm or the number of calories you burn a day.
		Greek yogurt is even more filling. It also helped with appetite control. Some yogurts even have important probiotics that benefit your digestive system. 
		All the vitamins, probiotics and minerals will help boost your immune system.</p>
		<p>Along with all its other benefits it can be relatively low calorie. Greek yogurt especially. Its a great snack, it could even be a great breakfast. Cold oatmeal is great with some greek yogurt.
